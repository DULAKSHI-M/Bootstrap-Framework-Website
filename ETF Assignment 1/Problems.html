    <h2><u><b>Effects of climate change</b></u></h2><br>
    <p><h5>Due to climate change the Arctic is heating up twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet, shrinking the Arctic sea ice cover by 14% per decade. Compared to the median sea ice cover recorded between 1981-2010, we have lost about 770,000 square miles, an area larger than Alaska and California combined.</h5></p><br>

      <i><h5 class="card-title">Fewer opportunities to feed</h5></i>
      <p class="card-text">Polar bears rely on sea ice to hunt and store energy for the summer and autumn, when food can be scarce. Sea ice now melts earlier in the spring and forms later in the autumn in the bears’ southern range, like Hudson Bay and James Bay in Canada. As the bears spend longer periods without food, their health declines. For every week earlier the ice breaks up in Hudson Bay, bears come ashore roughly 10 kg (22 lbs) lighter and in poorer condition.. </p>

      <p class="card-text">Some polar bears may suffer from malnutrition.In extreme cases they may face starvation especially females with cubs.Unhealthy bears can lead to lower reproduction rates and extinction in certaions.Scientists have found the main cause of death for cubs to be either lack of food or lack of fat on nursing mothers.</p>

    <h2><u><b>Industrial Impacts-Toxic pollution</b></u></h2><br>
    <p><h5>As top predators, polar bears are exposed to high levels of pollutants through their food. The popular image is of polar bears living in a pure, frozen wilderness is misleading. The Arctic food chain contains high levels of some toxic chemicals.</h5></p><br>

      <i><h5 class="card-title">Disruption of biological functions</h5></i>
      <p class="card-text">Bears with high levels of some POPs (persistent organic pollutants) have low levels of vitamin A, thyroid hormones, and some antibodies. These are important for a wide range of biological functions, such as growth, reproduction, and the ability to fight off diseases. Females with partially-developed male sexual organs -- Pseudohermaphrodites - have been observed in 1.5 % of the polar bears sampled on Svalbard in recent years. Scientists believe this could be the result of long-range pollutants. </p>

    <h2><u><b>Oil exploration</b></u></h2><br>
    <p><h5>The oil and gas business is increasingly moving into the Arctic as more accessible reserves in the south dry up. Polar bear populations are expected to come under increased pressure if oil developments in the Arctic go ahead according to industry plans. Offshore operations pose the greatest risk, since routine emissions, spills or leaks will be discharged directly into the sea or on the sea ice.</h5></p><br>
